I'm not a professional right now but watch me learn.

My journey has started last year with programming in Visual Basics for Applications so I‘m able to make Excel do some things like prime factorization or more intelligent working with sheets.
Added later: I have now been able to write my prime factorization in JavaScript. Proud that it worked so quickly. :D

That's much of abstract applied knowledge and as I‘ve found my interest in topic, I‘ve started with learning. I'm in a course right now for WebDev and I expect it will increase my expertise in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


So far my expectations have been exceeded. I am excited to discover new code snippets every day and am happy to be able to lead the tutoring classes. So that we can benefit together from what we have learned.


In future you will find some more informations here and also projects but for now this have to be enough 'cause I really don't know what to write else.

If you read until this point here's something funny for you:
> Why do programmers prefer dark mode?

> Because light attracts bugs!
