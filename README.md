I'm not a professional right now but watch me learn.

My journey started last year with programming in **V**isual **B**asics for **A**pplications so I could make Excel do some things like prime factorization or more intelligent working with sheets.
That's much of abstract applied knowledge and as I found my interest in topic, I started with learning. I'm in a course right now for WebDev and I expect it will increase my expertise in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In future you will find some more informations here and also projects but for now this have to be enough 'cause I really don't know what to write else.

If you read until this point here's something funny for you:
> Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
>
> Because light attracts bugs!
